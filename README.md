# OmniGallery
OmniGallery is a gallery for OmniFocus 2 themes, heavily inspired by Ulysses’s theme gallery.

This application is built to be entirely serverless, the backend is hosted entirely within AWS, utilizing a variety of Lambda functions, and a few other AWS resources. The frontend of OmniGallery is built in Angular and available under the `ui/` folder. 

I may split the repositories at some point and create a separate repository for the backend to live, but for now they’re both here.
